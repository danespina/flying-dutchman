## Gameplay and Features

As the captain of the Flying Dutchman, you have been tasked with collecting the souls of those lost at sea.  Move left and right using "A" and "D."  Jump over the ghosts by pressing the space key to collect souls!

+ Player controlled jumping ship
+ Ghosts moving toward the player to be jumped
+ Waves that interact with the ship (change height and velocity)
+ Ship can move left and right

## Look and Feel

The game features the juxtaposition of a playful ghost against a dark and stormy background, reflecting the similar contrast between the light and fun gameplay with the serious backstory.

The physics were designed to mimic the feel of a ship on the high seas.  The player feels the peak and trough of each wave.  After each jump, gravity brings the player back to sea level.
